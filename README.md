# just-another-text-editor
A text editor with syntax highlighting, that can also be installed as a native app.

## Description

I was motivated to create this project as a means to continue practicing with a client/server model, indexedDB and webpack. I built this app in order to create a way to save notes and code snippets, even when I don't have an internet connection. The biggest learning experience for me here was having the app save to the database, or local storage (when not connected to the internet) and then having it pull from either of those options to display the saved notes.

## Installation

The steps to install my project are as follows:

- Clone or fork my code from GitHub
- Install the required dependencies
- Run "npm run build" to start the servers

## Usage

This is an example of JATE working from the browser (Chrome):
